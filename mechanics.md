# ðŸ”¥ Firestarter: Custom Mechanics
There are plenty of custom mechanics on Firestarter that we added to complement vanilla gameplay. Sadly, many players are unaware of these and as such, this guide will outline everything you need to know!

## Dragon elytra drops
Every time the Ender Dragon is killed, it has a 50% chance to drop fully damaged elytra! These elytra can be repaired with phantom membranes to restore them to maximum durability, as per usual.

## Lava sponges
Placing a wet sponge near lava will turn nearby lava sources into cobblestone!

## Terracotta and wool redying
Wool and terracotta of any color can be dyed to any other color of their respective block by simply using dye in a crafting grid. Surrounding any dye with 8 of any color terracotta will craft terracotta of the color of the dye.

Similarly, placing any color wool and and one of any color dye will craft wool of the color of the dye.

## Coal blocks from charcoal
Coal blocks can be crafted with not only coal, but also charcoal. Simply fill the crafting grid with charcoal to craft a coal block.

## Automated jukebox reloading
Firing a dispenser with a disc into a jukebox will start playing the disc in the jukebox. Firing the dispenser again will eject the current disc in the jukebox. This mechanic can be automated with a clever setup.

## Picking up placed spawners
Placed spawners can be picked up with their mob type in place by simply mining the spawner block with a Silk Touch enchanted pickaxe. Placing the dropped spawner will place it with its correct mob type, just like it was before it was mined.

## Custom potions
McMMO has tons of custom potion types which can be brewed in a brewing stand. View them [here](https://mcmmo.fandom.com/wiki/Alchemy).
